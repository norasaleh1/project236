Our project discusses the measurement of external influences on students' mental health, such as study duration, sleep duration,
healthy habits, academic pressure, and so on. We chose this topic because it significantly affects our generation today due to the increase in cases of depression among
students caused by multiple factors such as academic pressure, financial stress, and study hours, which highlights the importance of studying their correlation with depression.
